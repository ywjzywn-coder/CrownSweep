> 💡 This repo is the free open-source CLI (`mo`). Prefer a native app? [Mole for Mac](https://mole.fit/) is a separate download: cleanup, app management, maintenance, disk maps, and live status in one lightweight, VoiceOver-ready app. One license covers 2 Macs with free updates and a 14-day refund. `brew install mole` installs the CLI only.

## Features

- **All-in-one CLI toolkit**: Combines CleanMyMac, AppCleaner, DaisyDisk, and iStat Menus style workflows in a **single terminal binary**
- **Deep cleaning**: Removes caches, logs, leftovers, and orphaned app data to **reclaim gigabytes of space**
- **Smart uninstaller**: Removes apps plus launch agents, preferences, and **hidden remnants**
- **Disk insights**: Visualizes usage, finds large files, **rebuilds caches**, and refreshes system services
- **Live monitoring**: Shows real-time CPU, GPU, memory, disk, and network stats

## Quick Start

Mole requires macOS 12 or newer and supports both Intel and Apple Silicon Macs.

**Install via Homebrew**

```bash
brew install mole
```

If Homebrew no longer supports your macOS version, use the script below instead.

**Or via script**

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/mole/main/install.sh | bash
```

Mole is built for macOS. An experimental Windows version lives in the [windows branch](https://github.com/tw93/Mole/tree/windows).

**Run**

```bash
mo                           # Interactive menu
mo clean                     # Deep cleanup + already-uninstalled app leftovers
mo uninstall                 # Remove installed apps + their leftovers
mo optimize                  # Refresh caches & services
mo analyze                   # Visual disk explorer (or 'mo analyse')
mo status                    # Live system health dashboard
mo purge                     # Clean project build artifacts
mo installer                 # Find and remove installer files

mo touchid                   # Configure Touch ID for sudo
mo completion                # Set up shell tab completion
mo update                    # Update Mole
mo update --nightly          # Update to latest unreleased main build, script install only
mo remove                    # Remove Mole from system
mo --help                    # Show help
mo --version                 # Show installed version
```

**Preview safely**

```bash
mo clean --dry-run
mo uninstall --dry-run
mo optimize --dry-run
mo purge --dry-run
mo installer --dry-run
mo history
mo history --json

mo clean --dry-run --debug   # Preview + detailed logs
mo optimize --whitelist      # Manage protected optimization rules
mo clean --whitelist         # Manage protected caches
mo purge --paths             # Configure project scan directories
mo analyze /Volumes          # Analyze external drives only
mo analyze /private/tmp      # Review user-owned temporary directories
```

Selections made with `mo clean --whitelist` persist in `~/.config/mole/whitelist`.

<details>
<summary><strong>Other install options</strong></summary>

To install a specific release, pass any tag from the [releases page](https://github.com/tw93/mole/releases), with or without its leading `V`. To track the development branch instead, pass `main`:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/mole/main/install.sh | bash -s -- 1.51.0
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/mole/main/install.sh | bash -s -- main
```

`main` installs unreleased code from the default branch, so expect rough edges. `latest` still works as a legacy alias for `main`; despite the name it does not install the newest stable release.

The script normally installs to `/usr/local/bin`, which may ask for an administrator password. Install into a user-owned directory if you want future `mo update` runs to stay password-free:

```bash
mkdir -p "$HOME/.local/bin"
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/mole/main/install.sh | bash -s -- --prefix "$HOME/.local/bin"
export PATH="$HOME/.local/bin:$PATH"
```

Add the same `PATH` export to `~/.zshrc` or your shell profile for new terminals. Mole updates the installation you invoked, so it keeps using this directory. Commands that change system-owned files may still request administrator access.

## Safety

Mole can remove files, so it validates paths, protects shared and system-owned locations, and asks for confirmation when an action needs it. When Mole cannot prove an item is safe to change, it skips or refuses it.

- `clean`, `uninstall`, `purge`, `installer`, and `remove` can delete files. Review them with `--dry-run` first, and add `--debug` when needed.
- Run Mole without `sudo`; it requests administrator access only when needed.
- `mo analyze` moves selected items to Trash after confirmation.
- Cleanup activity is recorded in `~/Library/Logs/mole/operations.log`; review it with `mo history` or disable it with `MO_NO_OPLOG=1`.
- Protect caches with `mo clean --whitelist`, or maintenance items with `mo optimize --whitelist`.

Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and [SECURITY_AUDIT.md](SECURITY_AUDIT.md) for reporting guidance, safety boundaries, and current limitations.

## Features in Detail

The examples below are shortened. Available items, sizes, and skip reasons depend on your Mac.

### Clean

`mo clean` reviews known-safe caches, logs, temporary files, developer artifacts, and leftovers from apps that are no longer installed. Use `mo clean --dry-run` to preview eligible paths, and `mo clean --whitelist` to protect caches you want to keep.

$ mo clean

### Uninstall

`mo uninstall` removes an installed app together with related files that Mole can tie back to that app. It keeps shared data when another installed copy still uses it. Use `mo uninstall --dry-run` to review the plan. If the app is already gone, use `mo clean` to look for leftovers.

$ mo uninstall

### Optimize

`mo optimize` runs bounded maintenance for supported Finder, network, database, and macOS services. Tasks that are unnecessary, unsafe at the moment, or unavailable are skipped with a reason. Use `mo optimize --dry-run` to preview the pass and `mo optimize --whitelist` to exclude tasks or path patterns.

```text
$ mo optimize

======================================================================
```

Path patterns work too, so you can keep a long-lived mounted disk image around, for example `/Volumes/mail`, without it showing up as a detach candidate.

### Analyze

`mo analyze` opens a terminal disk explorer. It supports arrow keys and Vim navigation, filtering, multi-selection, Finder preview, and confirmed moves to Trash. External drives are skipped from the default overview; inspect them with `mo analyze /Volumes` or a specific mount path. Use `mo analyze /private/tmp` to review user-owned temporary files without turning them into automatic cleanup targets.

A size ending in `+` contains measured bytes from a partial scan; `unknown` means the size could not be measured. Results cut short by temporary failures such as timeouts do not replace complete cached measurements, and a later refresh can recover the missing data. Folders macOS will not let the terminal read stay partial until access changes. The terminal list keeps the 30 largest entries, so an unreadable entry may fall outside that list; the total still indicates a partial scan. Directory JSON output includes all scanned entries.

`mo analyze --json /path` includes `scan_status` on the result and each entry: `complete`, `partial`, or `unavailable`. Numeric sizes contain measured bytes; a zero with `unavailable` does not mean an empty directory. Partial scans still exit successfully, so automation should inspect `scan_status`. Completeness applies within Mole's existing scan exclusions and does not promise an atomic filesystem snapshot.

```

### Status

`mo status` is a read-only dashboard for hardware, system pressure, disk activity, network traffic, power, and processes.

When the IPv4 default route uses a tunnel, network graphs use that interface’s rates to avoid counting the same traffic again on its physical carrier. JSON retains per-interface rates, including the routed tunnel; idle non-default tunnels stay hidden.

<summary><strong>JSON, NDJSON, and process alerts</strong></summary>

- `mo analyze --json ~/Documents` returns a one-time disk report as JSON.
- `mo status --json` returns a one-time status snapshot as JSON.
- `mo status | jq '.health_score'` switches to JSON automatically when output is piped.
- `mo status --watch --interval 2s` streams newline-delimited JSON from a warm collector.
- `mo history --json` returns cleanup activity as JSON.

```text
$ mo analyze --json ~/Documents
{
  "path": "/Users/you/Documents",
  "overview": false,
  "entries": [
    { "name": "Library", "path": "...", "size": 80939438080, "is_dir": true }
  ],
  "large_files": [

  ],

}

$ mo status --json
{
  "host": "MacBook-Pro",
  "health_score": 92,
  "cpu": { "usage": 45.2, "logical_cpu": 8 },
  "memory": { "total": 34359738368, "used": 20078972109, "used_percent": 58.4 },
  "disks": [],
  "process_collected_at": "2026-08-29T12:30:00Z",
  "process_stale": false,
  "zombie_count": 3,
  "zombie_parents": [
    { "pid": 4242, "name": "Google Chrome for Testing", "count": 3 }
  ],
  "zombie_parents_complete": true,
  "uptime": "3d 12h 45m"
}
```

Zombie diagnostics are read-only and do not affect the health score or terminate processes. Before
Mole has a successful process sample, `process_collected_at`, `process_stale`, `zombie_count`, and
`zombie_parents_complete` are omitted and `zombie_parents` is `null`. Later fast/watch snapshots
reuse the latest successful sample with its original `process_collected_at` and set
`process_stale: true`; a live process sample sets it to `false`. A count of `0` means Mole measured
no zombies. Parent summaries contain at most three known owners;
`zombie_parents_complete: false` means attribution was unavailable, incomplete, or truncated.

If one collector fails, `mo status --json` still prints the metrics that were collected, reports the
failure on stderr, and exits successfully, the same way `--watch` keeps streaming. It exits 1
when none of CPU, memory, disk, or process metrics are available, or when JSON output fails.

Status also supports read-only alerts for processes that stay above a CPU threshold. Use `--proc-cpu-threshold`, `--proc-cpu-window`, or `--proc-cpu-alerts=false` to tune or disable them.

</details>

### Purge

`mo purge` finds rebuildable project artifacts such as `node_modules`, `target`, `.build`, `build`, and `dist`. It groups artifacts by project and permanently deletes only the items you confirm. Artifacts with file activity in the last 7 days, or activity Mole cannot verify, are unselected by default. Mole uses `fd` when available and falls back to `find`. Directories containing deployment keypair files, nested Git repositories, or Git-tracked files are protected. Non-interactive runs require `mo purge --yes`; use `mo purge --dry-run` to review the candidates first.

Use Page Up/Down or `h`/`l` to move a page, `[`/`]` to jump between projects, and `X` to skip a project and advance. `/` searches project paths and artifact names; `n` finds the next match without changing selections. Enter opens the final path review. Reported space is an estimate; unmeasured artifacts and incomplete scans are identified explicitly.

<summary><strong>Custom Scan Paths</strong></summary>

Run `mo purge --paths` to configure scan directories, or edit `~/.config/mole/purge_paths` directly:

```shell
~/Documents/MyProjects
~/Work/ClientA
~/Work/ClientB
```

When custom paths are configured, Mole scans only those directories. Otherwise, it uses defaults like `~/Projects`, `~/GitHub`, `~/dev`, and supported agent worktree containers. Discovery does not save an incomplete result. Artifact scans reach six levels below each configured root; add a nearer root for deeper projects. Purge removes rebuildable artifacts inside worktrees, never the worktrees themselves.

</details>

### Installer

`mo installer` finds DMG, PKG, MPKG, ISO, XIP, and installer ZIP files in Downloads, Desktop, Homebrew caches, iCloud, Mail, Telegram, and other supported locations. Each item shows its size and source before removal. Use `mo installer --dry-run` to preview the plan. Discovery has a cumulative time limit. If a scan or metadata probe fails or times out, Mole discards the list and exits without selecting files; corrupt and unreadable ZIP archives are skipped. Symlinked scan roots are supported, but symlinks beneath them are not followed. Selected files are checked again against their confirmed identity at the deletion boundary.

## Quick Launchers

<details>
<summary><strong>Raycast and Alfred setup</strong></summary>

Install five launchers for Clean, Uninstall, Optimize, Analyze, and Status:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tw93/Mole/main/scripts/setup-quick-launchers.sh | bash
```

The script adds Raycast commands and, when Alfred preferences are present, matching Alfred workflows with the keywords `clean`, `uninstall`, `optimize`, `analyze`, and `status`.

Raycast needs one manual setup:

1. Open **Raycast Settings > Extensions > Script Commands**.
2. Add `~/Library/Application Support/Raycast/script-commands` as a script directory.
3. Run **Reload Script Directories** in Raycast.

The launchers auto-detect Terminal, iTerm2, Alacritty, kitty, WezTerm, Ghostty, Hyper, WindTerm, and Warp. Set `MO_LAUNCHER_APP=<name>` to choose one; you can also run Mole directly in [Kaku](https://github.com/tw93/Kaku).
